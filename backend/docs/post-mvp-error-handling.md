# Post-MVP Error Handling Requirements

This document outlines the error handling features that will be implemented after the MVP release.

## Current MVP Implementation

The MVP includes:

- ✅ **Exception Hierarchy**: Clean domain-specific exceptions with clear inheritance
- ✅ **Error Integration**: Domain exceptions integrated into document parser with HTTP conversion
- ✅ **Structured Logging**: Context-rich error reporting with operation details
- ✅ **Basic Testing**: Comprehensive test suite for core error handling

## Post-MVP Features (Deferred)

### 1. Edge Case Handling Strategy

**Scope**: Comprehensive identification and handling of rare failure scenarios

- **Legal Document Edge Cases**:
  - Documents with complex nested structures
  - Multi-language legal documents
  - Documents with embedded images/tables affecting text extraction
  - Corrupted metadata or partial file corruption
- **Implementation**:
  - Catalog edge cases through production usage data
  - Create specific handlers for each category
  - Add retry mechanisms for transient failures

### 2. Graceful Degradation Logic

**Scope**: System continues operating in reduced capacity during failures

- **Document Processing Fallbacks**:
  - If advanced parsing fails → fallback to basic text extraction
  - If chunking fails → return document as single chunk
  - If embedding fails → store document without vector search capability
- **User Experience**:
  - Clear communication about reduced functionality
  - Partial results rather than complete failure
  - Automatic retry suggestions where appropriate

### 3. Enhanced Monitoring & Alerting

**Scope**: Production monitoring and proactive error detection

- **Error Aggregation**:
  - Error rate monitoring by operation type
  - Pattern detection for recurring issues
  - Performance impact tracking
- **Alerting System**:
  - Threshold-based alerts for error spikes
  - Integration with external monitoring services
  - Automated escalation for critical failures

### 4. Advanced Error Recovery

**Scope**: Automatic error recovery and self-healing capabilities

- **Retry Mechanisms**:
  - Exponential backoff for transient failures
  - Circuit breaker pattern for external service failures
  - Queue-based retry for processing pipeline errors
- **Data Recovery**:
  - Automatic reprocessing of failed documents
  - Backup/restore mechanisms for corrupted data
  - Rollback capabilities for processing failures

### 5. User-Facing Error Communication

**Scope**: Improved error messages and user guidance

- **Error Message Enhancement**:
  - User-friendly error descriptions
  - Actionable recommendations for resolution
  - Context-aware help documentation
- **Error Recovery Guidance**:
  - Step-by-step troubleshooting guides
  - Alternative workflow suggestions
  - Contact/support integration for unresolvable issues

### 6. Comprehensive Testing Suite

**Scope**: Extended testing for edge cases and failure scenarios

- **Edge Case Testing**:
  - Comprehensive test suite for identified edge cases
  - Stress testing with malformed documents
  - Performance testing under error conditions
- **Integration Testing**:
  - End-to-end error scenario testing
  - Cross-service error propagation testing
  - Recovery mechanism validation

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1** (Immediately post-MVP):

1. Enhanced monitoring & alerting
2. Basic graceful degradation for critical paths

**Phase 2** (Short-term):
3. Edge case handling strategy implementation
4. User-facing error communication improvements

**Phase 3** (Medium-term):
5. Advanced error recovery mechanisms
6. Comprehensive testing suite expansion

## Success Metrics

- **Error Rate**: < 1% for document processing operations
- **Recovery Time**: < 30 seconds for automatic recovery scenarios
- **User Experience**: Clear error resolution path for 95% of user-facing errors
- **System Availability**: 99.9% uptime with graceful degradation during failures

## Technical Considerations

- **Performance Impact**: Error handling should add < 5% overhead to normal operations
- **Storage Requirements**: Error logs and recovery data should be efficiently managed
- **Scalability**: Error handling system must scale with increased document volume
- **Security**: Error logs must not expose sensitive document content or user data
