			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Migrate Vite Project to Next.js 14+ with App Router",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Vite to Next.js migration into a sequence of five distinct steps: 1. Initialize the new Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind. 2. Migrate and adapt the `tailwind.config` and `tsconfig.json` files. 3. Copy all existing React components into the new structure. 4. Create the App Router directory structure for `/`, `/upload`, and `/chat`. 5. Create placeholder `page.tsx` files to validate routing and basic setup.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is moderate, stemming from the need to translate configurations and project structure between two distinct ecosystems (Vite and Next.js). While the steps are clear, subtle differences in path aliasing, environment variables, and CSS handling can introduce unexpected issues. The 5 subtasks logically segment the migration process, minimizing risk."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Root Layout and Page Routing",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the root layout and routing implementation into five subtasks: 1. Create the root `layout.tsx` and a basic landing `page.tsx`. 2. Create placeholder pages for the `/upload` and `/chat` routes. 3. Develop a reusable `<Navigation>` component with links. 4. Integrate the `<Navigation>` component into the root layout. 5. Set up a global React Context provider within the root layout.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves standard Next.js App Router patterns. The complexity is moderate because it combines several distinct concepts (layout, routing, state management), but each is relatively simple and well-documented. The 5 subtasks correctly isolate each concept, making the implementation straightforward."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Build and Integrate the Document Upload Page",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the document upload page feature into five functional parts: 1. Set up the `/upload` page and integrate the static `DocumentUpload` component. 2. Implement the file upload API call (`POST /documents/upload`). 3. Create a `DocumentTable` component to fetch and display documents (`GET /documents`). 4. Implement status polling to automatically update 'Processing' documents. 5. Add the document deletion functionality (`DELETE /documents/{id}`).",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the combination of file handling, multiple asynchronous API interactions (upload, list, delete), and stateful client-side logic like status polling. Coordinating these elements and managing loading/error states for each action is challenging. The 5 subtasks effectively break down the feature by user action/flow."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop and Integrate the Chat Interface Page",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Deconstruct the chat interface development into a five-step process: 1. Set up the basic page structure and integrate static chat components. 2. Implement the logic to check for 'Ready' documents and conditionally show the UI. 3. Build the user input form and implement optimistic UI updates for the conversation history. 4. Integrate the backend API call for chat queries, including a 'Thinking...' loading state. 5. Handle the API response and errors, updating the conversation with the assistant's message.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the real-time, stateful nature of a chat interface. It requires managing optimistic UI updates, asynchronous API calls, loading states, and conditional rendering based on external data (document status). The 5 subtasks provide a clear, step-by-step guide to building this complex interactive feature."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Interactive Citation Preview System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the citation preview system into five implementation stages: 1. Create a citation parser and a non-interactive `CitationTag` component. 2. Develop the static UI for the `CitationViewer` popover, including loading/error states. 3. Implement the click-to-open logic to show the viewer. 4. Integrate the API call to fetch the citation snippet. 5. Display the fetched snippet content in the viewer and handle API errors.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is driven by the need to combine text parsing (regex), dynamic UI generation, popover state management, and a new asynchronous API call. Each step builds on the last, requiring careful integration. The 5 subtasks correctly isolate each concern, from parsing to final data display."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Apply Harvey.ai UI Polish and Responsive Design",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure the UI polish and responsive design effort into five phases: 1. Configure the Tailwind theme with the new color palette and typography. 2. Refactor all core, reusable UI components to match the new aesthetic. 3. Apply the new theme and spacing to all main application pages. 4. Implement responsive layouts for tablet and desktop screens. 5. Add a persistent light/dark mode toggle.",
			"reasoning": "This task's complexity comes from its broad scope, touching every component and page. It requires a systematic approach to ensure visual consistency. Implementing responsiveness and a theme-toggle system adds significant technical depth beyond simple styling. The 5 subtasks provide a structured approach to this app-wide refactor."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Error Handling and Accessibility",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the error handling and accessibility task into five key initiatives: 1. Implement a global toast notification system for user feedback. 2. Wrap all API calls with centralized error handling logic. 3. Add client-side validation to the file upload form. 4. Create and integrate a generic `EmptyState` component for views with no data. 5. Conduct a full accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) and performance audit, and implement fixes.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the meticulous and wide-ranging nature of the work. Implementing a consistent error handling strategy and conducting a thorough accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA) requires specialized knowledge and affects the entire codebase. The 5 subtasks correctly address distinct areas of application hardening."
